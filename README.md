## My Data Philosophy

I believe data is only as good as the story it tells. My approach follows a strict pipeline:

1. **Sourcing & Integrity:** Ensuring a "Single Version of Truth" through rigorous SQL cleaning.
2. **Exploration:** Using EDA to find the "Why" behind the "What."
3. **Visualization:** Creating intuitive dashboards that non-technical stakeholders can use to make decisions.
