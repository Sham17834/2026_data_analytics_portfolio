**Key Deliverables & Insights:**

* **Operational Audit:** Identified a critical failure point where **66% of all orders** were either delayed or cancelled. This correlated directly with a low  **Average Rating of 3.00** , indicating a significant threat to brand loyalty.
* **Market Segmentation:** Analyzed demographic data to find that **Teenagers** are the most lucrative segment, contributing **RM 1.65M** in total spend. This suggests that marketing efforts should pivot toward fast-food promotions tailored to younger audiences.
* **Geographic Performance:** Discovered that **Multan** outperformed capital cities in revenue ($1,009,003), highlighting a need for localized logistics expansion in that region.

* **Technical Integrity:** Implemented a **SQL-based cleaning pipeline** to handle null values, remove duplicates, and perform whitespace scrubbing to ensure a "Single Version of Truth" before visualization.
